The Grocery Tracker project aims to provide a solution for tracking the frequency of items purchased in a grocery store. By analyzing input data files containing records of purchased items, the program generates frequency lists and histograms, allowing users to understand which items are purchased most frequently.

What was done well:
Modularity: The code is well-structured into a class-based design, separating concerns and promoting reusability.
Input Validation: The program implements input validation to ensure user-entered choices are within the expected range, enhancing robustness.
File Handling: Effective utilization of file streams for loading input data and backing up frequency map data.
Areas for Enhancement:
Error Handling: Enhancing error handling mechanisms can provide more informative messages to users in case of failures, improving usability.
Memory Management: Employing smart pointers or other memory management techniques could enhance memory efficiency, especially for larger datasets.
Security: Implementing measures such as data encryption for the backup file could enhance the security of stored information.
Challenging Pieces:
The most challenging aspect of the project was ensuring robust input validation while maintaining a user-friendly interface. Overcoming this involved carefully designing the input loop and implementing error handling strategies. Additionally, understanding and implementing file handling operations efficiently posed some difficulties, which were resolved through experimentation and reference to documentation.

Support Network:
During the development process, various online resources such as C++ documentation, forums, and tutorials were utilized for guidance and problem-solving. Additionally, collaborating with peers and seeking feedback facilitated learning and improvement.

Transferable Skills:
Several skills developed during this project are highly transferable to other programming endeavors:

Object-Oriented Design: Understanding and implementing class-based designs promote reusable and maintainable code.
File Handling: Proficiency in handling file operations is applicable across various domains, including data processing and management.
Input Validation: Mastery of input validation techniques ensures the robustness and usability of interactive programs.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:
To ensure the program remains maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

Descriptive Naming: Meaningful variable names and comments enhance code readability and maintainability.
Modular Design: Breaking down functionality into smaller, cohesive units promotes adaptability and ease of maintenance.
Consistent Formatting: Following consistent coding conventions and formatting standards improves code readability and comprehension.
